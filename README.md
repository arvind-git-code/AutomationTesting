# Automation Test Utilities

This repository contains reusable utility classes for automating various test scenarios. These utilities are designed to be framework-agnostic, meaning they can be integrated into any testing framework built with Java, Selenium WebDriver, and TestNG. The purpose is to create a central archive of commonly used test steps and functionalities, promoting code reuse and reducing development time.

**Key Features:**

*   **Framework-Independent:** Utilities can be used with different testing frameworks.
*   **Reusable Test Steps:** Provides pre-built methods for common actions like browser navigation, element interaction, data validation, and more.
*   **Modular Design:** Utilities are organized into separate classes based on functionality, making it easy to find and use specific utilities.
*   **TestNG Integration:** Utilizes TestNG annotations for basic test execution and reporting within the utility classes themselves for easy demonstration and individual test execution.
*   **Selenium WebDriver:** Leverages Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
*   **Maven Dependency Management:** Uses Maven for dependency management, making it easy to include these utilities in your projects.

**Technologies Used:**

*   Java
*   Selenium WebDriver
*   TestNG
*   Maven
